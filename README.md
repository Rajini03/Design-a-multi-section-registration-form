Multi-Section Registration Form

This project is an interactive and responsive registration form designed for an online course platform. 
The form consists of multiple sections that guide users through the registration process, ensuring a smooth user experience.

**Key Features:**

**1. Multi-Section Layout:**

The form is divided into four main sections:

* Personal Information: Collects user details like full name, email, phone number, date of birth, and gender.
* Course Selection: Allows users to choose a course, preferred start date, and time.
* Payment Details: Gathers credit card information and billing address.
* Account Setup: Includes username, password, security question, and answer.

**2. Responsive Design:**

* The form adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

**3. Validation and Error Handling:**

* Input fields include validation to ensure required fields are completed correctly, with error messages displayed for incorrect inputs.

**4. Progress Tracking:**

*  A progress indicator shows the user's current step in the registration process (e.g., "Step 1 of 4").

**5. Summary Review:**

* A summary page at the end allows users to review all entered details before final submission.

**6. Save Progress:**

* Users can save their progress and return later, enhancing usability for those who may not complete the form in one sitting.

7. Accessibility Considerations:

* The form incorporates accessibility features, such as ARIA labels and proper focus management, to ensure all users can navigate and complete the form.



**Technology Stack:**

* HTML: Structure of the form.
* CSS: Styling and responsive design.
* JavaScript: Dynamic behavior, validation, and form navigation.



This project aims to streamline the registration process for users while providing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
